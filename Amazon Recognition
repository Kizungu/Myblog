Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based machine learning service 
provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications. 
It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities within images and videos.

Rekognition can be used for a wide range of applications such as image and video analysis, facial recognition, celebrity recognition, object detection
and tracking, text detection, and scene detection. It can also be used for video and image moderation, 
which means detecting inappropriate or harmful content in videos and images.
Amazon Rekognition is available as a fully-managed service, which means that you don't need to worry about infrastructure, scaling, or maintenance.
You simply upload your images or videos to the service, and it provides you with detailed analysis and metadata about them. 
It also integrates with other AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis, making it easy to build scalable, end-to-end solutions.
